# Project: "AsifThatWorks" - AI Agent Platform

## High-Level Business Plan

**Mission:** To provide a suite of specialized AI agents that help busy professionals and individuals manage their digital lives with ease and personality.

**Target Audience:**
*   Busy professionals, entrepreneurs, and freelancers who need to delegate tasks and manage their time effectively.
*   Individuals who want a personalized and engaging AI assistant to help them with their daily routines.

**Value Proposition:**
*   **A Fleet of Personalities:** Unlike monolithic AI assistants, our platform offers a variety of agents with distinct personas, making task management more engaging and enjoyable.
*   **Specialized Expertise:** Each agent is an expert in its domain, providing more accurate and efficient results than a general-purpose AI.
*   **Seamless Integration:** The platform integrates with the tools you already use (Google Calendar, Google Tasks, WhatsApp, etc.), making it easy to incorporate into your existing workflow.
*   **Long-Term Memory:** Our "Forever Brain" feature ensures that your agents remember your preferences and context, providing a truly personalized experience.

**Monetization Strategy:**
*   **Subscription-Based:** The platform will be offered as a subscription service with different tiers:
    *   **Free Tier:** Includes the core agents (JARVI, GRIM, MURPHY) with limited usage.
    *   **Pro Tier:** Includes the core agents with unlimited usage and access to some add-on agents.
    *   **Business Tier:** Includes all agents, advanced features, and priority support.
*   **Add-on Agents:** Users can purchase additional agents (VOICE, ECHO, PIXEL, SCOUT) as add-ons to their subscription.
